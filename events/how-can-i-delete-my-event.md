# How can I delete my event?

Event planning can have all sorts of hiccups - venues cancel, presenters get sick, vice squad raided last week, etc.  So sometimes you just need to delete an event that you've created. How do you do that? Simple - go to the Edit Event page. Click on the "Delete Event" link, and it's gone! An email will go out to everyone who has RSVPd to the event that it has been deleted.
