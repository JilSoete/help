# How do notifications work?

If someone posts on your profile you will get an notification at the top of your page and in your https://fetlife.com/notifications page.

- This includes things like comments on your pics, vids, writings and wall.
- When someone loves on your pics, vids and writings.
- When someone follows you (If you have following enabled)
- When someone comments @YourFetLifeName if you have these notification enabled (https://fetlife.com/settings/notifications)


So why do people type @yourname in the first place? It just makes the conversation easier to follow if there are a bunch of people. For example:

@person1 I agree with you totally

@person2 You're dead wrong!

@ing someone in a thread makes it clear who you are talking to, but it only gives a notification if they have them enabled in their Notification settings.
