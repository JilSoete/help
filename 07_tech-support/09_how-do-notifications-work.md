# How do notifications work?

If someone posts on your profile you will get a notification indication in the navigation on the top of the page and in your https://fetlife.com/notifications page.

You will be notified there when someone:

- comments or loves any of your status updates, pictures, videos or writings
- mentions you
- follows you
- accepts your friend request
- changes their relationship status with you

Additionally, you'll also receive FetLife Support related notifications.

So why do people type @yourname in the first place? It just makes the conversation easier to follow if there are a bunch of people. For example:

@person1 I agree with you totally

@person2 You're dead wrong!

Mentioning someone in a thread makes it clear who you are talking to, but it only gives a notification if they have them enabled in their Notification settings.
