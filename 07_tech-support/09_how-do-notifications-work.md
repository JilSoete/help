# How do @ notifications work?

If someone posts on your profile you will get an @ notification at the top of your page and in yourhttps://fetlife.com/ats page.

-This includes things like comments on your pics, vids, writings and wall.

-It also includes loves on your pics, vids and writings.

-It does NOT include any group comments, even if someone writes @yourname or replies to a group thread you started.

So why do people type @yourname in the first place? It just makes the conversation easier to follow if there are a bunch of people. For example:

@person1 I agree with you totally

@person2 You're dead wrong!

@ing someone in a thread makes it clear who you are talking to but it does not give anyone a notification.
