# Apple OS upgrade issues

A recent Apple OS update *(cough cough)* has caused a few settings to be changed on your Mac/Gadget (iPhone, iPad, etc.), which may be preventing you from logging into FetLife. To fix it, do the following:

1. Open the browser on your Mac/Gadget.
2. Go to the Settings
3. Look for "Allow Cookies" and change it to "Always Allow". While you're in the settings, clear your browser cache and history, then try logging in again.

If you're still experiencing any problems, please contact [support@fetlife.com](mailto:support@fetlife.com)
