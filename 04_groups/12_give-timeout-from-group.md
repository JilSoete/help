# How can I give a timeout to someone in my group?

A group leader has access to two type of timeouts:

- Temporary Timeout (max 30 days)
- Permanent Timeout (ban)

If you are a group leader, there's multiple ways to give a timeout to a member of your group:

- From a comment they've made (found under the "more" menu)
- From a group post they've made (found under the "options" menu)
- From the members list (found under the "Members" tab, under "moderate" on the member card)
