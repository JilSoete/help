# How can I give a timeout to someone in my group?

First of all, there are 2 types of timeouts:

- Temporary Timeout (max 30 days)
- Permanent Timeout or Ban

If you are a group leader, there's multiple ways to give a timeout to a member of your group:

- In the members tab (find the "moderate" dropdown on the member card)
- On a comment (find the "more" menu)
- On the group post (find the "options" menu)
