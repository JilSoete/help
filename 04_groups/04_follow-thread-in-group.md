# How do I follow a thread?

When you start a new or comment on a discussion you are automatically set to start following the thread. The threads you are already following are listed on your groups page and are updated when new comments are made to the discussion.

To stop or start following a thread, look under the original post in the thread and click "start following" or "stop following".
