# I’ve noticed a group owner has not checked on their group in a long time.  Can I take over group ownership?

If the group owner has been inactive for more than three months and there are no active group leaders, you can email support@fetlife.com  to give you the ok to post a discussion in the group to start a vote for ownership. The caretakers will reach out to the group owner to see if they want to come back. If there’s no reply within 7 days or the owner says "Nah, not coming back", then the caretakers will review the thread and make a final decision.

If there are other group leaders in addition to the owner, they have ‘first dibs’ on if they would like to own the group. If you yourself are a group leader, you may have the option to take ownership, so be sure to email the caretakers to find out.
