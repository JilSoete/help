# How do I unembed a video in my group?

YouTube video embedding is fun! But, with the proliferation of YouTube videos being posted in groups, some group owners have asked us "What do we do if there are minors in the videos?". Put simply - unembed the video. Links to pictures or videos with non-sexualized images of minors are ok. This leaves the link and the discussion in place, but removes the video from FetLife itself.

All you have to do is add [square brackets] around the link. For example:

[http://www.youtube.com/watch](http://www.youtube.com/watch.... "")........ - puts in an embedded video

[[http://www.youtube.com/watch](http://www.youtube.com/watch.... "")].... - takes out the embedding
