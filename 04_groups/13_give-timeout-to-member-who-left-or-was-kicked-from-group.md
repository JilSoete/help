# How can I give a timeout to someone who's already left my group?

When you want to give a timeout to someone who's already left the group, you can still do so from any post or comment they've left in the group.

If there are no group discussions or comments by that member in your group, you can contact [support@fetlife.com](mailto:support@fetlife.com) and ask one of the caretakers to do this for you.
