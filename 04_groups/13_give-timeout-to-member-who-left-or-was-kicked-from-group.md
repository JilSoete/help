# How can I give a timeout to someone who already left my group?

When someone you wanted to give a timeout already left the group you can still give them a timeout if they posted a group discussion or left a comment.

If there are no group discussions or comments by that member in your group, you can contact [support@fetlife.com](mailto:support@fetlife.com) and ask one of the caretakers to do this for you.

When you email the caretakers you should take advantage of the opportunity and report the member you want to give a timeout from your group.
