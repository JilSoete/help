# I keep getting an error

If you are sure that your name and password are correct but you keep getting an error message saying that your name or password is wrong... Make sure you have javascript enabled.

Go into your browser settings and:

-Enable javascript
-Disable any plugins or extensions that might be interfering with javascript

After you fail to login a few times there will be a CAPTCHA box to fill in below your password but without javascript it might not work properly. That means you will not see it at all even though the system still expects you to fill it out.
