# I forgot my password! What can I do?

You can reset your password by going to our [retrieve login information form](https://fetlife.com/users/password/new) and submitting your email address attached to your account. Once you do that we will send you an email with instructions on how you can reset your password.

Make sure you check your junk mail and spam filter because sometimes FetLife mail gets caught up in there. If that does not work for you don't hesitate to email [support@fetlife.com](mailto:support@fetlife.com?subject=Retrieve%20Login%20information).
