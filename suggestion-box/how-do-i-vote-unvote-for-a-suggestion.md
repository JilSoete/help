# How do I vote/unvote for a suggestion?

You vote for suggestions by clicking on the black box that says "Vote". The number of votes you have left out of your three appears on the right hand side of the screen, and the list of what you have voted for is below that. You can "unvote" by clicking on the red "Voted" button under the total number of votes.

Once a product is "In Progress", you can't unvote for it until it hits "Completed" - but then you automatically get your vote back!
