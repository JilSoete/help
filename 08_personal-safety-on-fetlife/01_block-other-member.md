# How do I block another Member?

Blocking another member is easy. There are two ways to do it.

1. Go to their profile. On the upper right side below the "Message Kinkster" and "Add to My Friends" rectangles, you will see two links - "report user" and "block user". Click on "block user", and through the wonders of artificial intelligence, they&rsquo;re blocked! To unblock them, click on the "unblock user" link.
2. If you are in a Private Message (PM) discussion with the person, on the right hand side of the screen there is a "Block user" link. You can click on it there to block the member. To unblock them, you have to go to their main profile as in 1.
