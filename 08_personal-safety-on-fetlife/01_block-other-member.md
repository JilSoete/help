# How do I block another Member?

Blocking another member is easy. There are two ways to do it.

1. Go to their profile.
2. On the upper-right side below "Message Kinkster" and "Add to My Friends", you will see two links - "report user" and "block user".
3. Click on "block user" and confirm that you want to block this member.

Alternatively, if you are in a Private Message (PM) discussion with the person, on the right hand side of the conversation there is a "Block user" link. You can click on it there to block the member.
