# What’s a “Time-Out”?

When we feel it is warranted, we may place a member on "Time Out". Essentially, what we're asking a member to do is to step back and re-evaluate what is going on, because often our only other option is to delete their profile and ban them from the site.

During a Time Out, a member is not allowed to log into FetLife or create or use alternate accounts to get around the time out. Doing so will only result in an extended time out, or worse - a FetLife Ban.
