# What’s a “Time-Out”?

Sometimes, a FetLife member just seems to be caught up in the rush of emotions that can sometimes result because of living on Internet time. When we feel it is warranted, we may place a member on "Time Out". Essentially, what we're asking a member to do is to step back and re-evaluate what is going on, because often our only other option is to delete their profile and ban them from the site. During a Time Out, a member is not allowed to do anything other than private messages on FetLife. Basically anything that would show on your activity feed (including editing your profile), or the creation or use of alternate accounts to get around the time out, is prohibited.
