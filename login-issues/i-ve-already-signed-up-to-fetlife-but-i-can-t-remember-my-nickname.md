# I've already signed up to FetLife but I can't remember my nickname.

If you remember the email address and password you used to sign-up to FetLife you can login using your email address instead of your nickname and you can just check out your profile to see what your nickname is.

If you can't remember your password follow the instructions to reset your password in the previous article [above](https://fetlife.com/help/7#assistly_article_39 "").
