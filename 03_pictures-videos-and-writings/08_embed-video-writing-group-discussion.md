# How do I embed a video?

It doesn't actually take any great programming talent to embed a video into your writing or group post. Hell, even John did it!

In your message, leave a blank line between your text and the link to the video you want to embed, and a blank line afterwards. Don't write on the line with the link. That's all!!!

For example, this will work:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaXLtPGrTGQ

This will not:

Here is another test https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaXLtPGrTGQ

Embedded video only works for Writings and Group initial posts for now, not in comments.

Please note you need to use the WATCH link, not the EMBED link from youtube.
