# How do I embed a video?

It doesn't take any great programming talent to embed a video into your writing or group post. Hell, even John did it!

In any Writing or a new Group Post, leave the link to the video on its own line. Don't write on the line with the link. That's all!!!

For example, this will work:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaXLtPGrTGQ

This will not:

Here is another test https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaXLtPGrTGQ

Please note you need to use the WATCH link, not the EMBED link from youtube.
