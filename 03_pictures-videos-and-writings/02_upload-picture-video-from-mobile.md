# How do I upload a picture or video to FetLife from my phone?

Yes, you can upload pics to your FetLife profile from your phone!

How so?

Via email of course! Each one of you will be assigned a unique email address that you can use to email in pictures on the go to your FetLife profile. Just copy the address to your phone's address book, and then anytime you are balls deep in that bitch's ass and want to share some action stills with us - you can! :-)

You can upload more then one picture at a time by just attaching multiple pics to the email. Something you can't even do from the website. Subject == Picture Caption. Just write the picture caption in the subject line. Easy cheesy.

Some things you should know:

* There is a 25MB limit on email size right. Depending on your phone, you should be good to send 5-10 pics in one email.
* For security reasons, you need to send the email from the email address that is associated to your FetLife account. We wouldn't want just anyone posting pics to your profile would you! I didn't think so! :-p
* Videos can't be uploaded directly, so feel free to send them to us for us to watch... I mean, to load for you!
* The address you upload FROM has to be the one you used to sign up for the site. The address you upload TO is shown on your "upload a pic" page
* If you're having problems, you can just email any pictures or videos you want posted on your profile to support@fetlife.com, and we will post them for you!
* In the Subject line of the email, if you start with "Private:", the picture will be posted as Friends Only. If you start with "Avatar:", it will be set as your avatar.
