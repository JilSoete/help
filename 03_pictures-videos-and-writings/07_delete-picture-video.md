# How do I delete or edit a Picture, Video or Writing?



Navigate to the picture or video you want to delete (make sure you're looking at the enlarged picture or playable video). Below the image on the lefthand side, click on "options" to open a small drop down menu, from here you'll have up to 3 options:

### Edit 
You can update the Caption, Tags and Privacy Settings by clicking "Edit". Fill out the pop up box and "Save Changes" Nifty?

### Set as Avatar
This will set the image as your main Avatar for your profile so you can show yourself off! 

### Delete 
You guessed it, you'll get a pop up box just to double check, confirm you want to delete and it's gone! 

If the picture is your Avatar, you will need to change your Avatar to a different picture, then you can delete it.
