# How do I edit or delete my Writing?

Navigate to the Writing or even your full list of Writings. In the top right hand corner of the Writing click the 3 dots to open the drop down menu:

#### Edit 
Here you can tinker with your Writing, update the Catagory and Tags as well as changing the Privacy Setting.

#### Delete 
We'll double check with a pop up box and when you confirm.. *poof* It's gone!

If you want to add extra features to your Writings, such as underlines, bold, different sized fonts, etc., check out the formatting guidelines at [https://fetlife.com/formatting_guidelines](https://fetlife.com/formatting_guidelines "").
