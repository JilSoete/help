# I want to delete a comment I made.

Unfortunately you can't delete a comment you made on someone else's picture, video, writing, status, or wall - but they can! We suggest you contact the owner of the profile you commented on and ask them to remove your comment. If it was a comment you made in a group, you have to contact the group owner to see if they will delete it for you.
