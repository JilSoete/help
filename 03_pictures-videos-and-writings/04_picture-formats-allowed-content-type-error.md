# I am getting a "Content type" error when uploading a picture - what formats are allowed?

Make sure the file extension of your picture is either: jpg, jpeg, gif, png or pjpeg. We accept gifs but we don't accept animated gifs, or bitmap images (.bmp).

If you can't figure out what the problem is send an email to support@fetlife.com with the image attached. That way we can look into it for you, help find out what&rsquo;s happening, and get you on your way to picture upload nirvana.
