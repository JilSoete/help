# How do I delete or archive a Message?

Just way too much correspondence to sift through, huh? What a great problem to have! And we have some tools to help you with it.

To delete a message, just open the message you want to delete by clicking on the subject line of the message. Now scroll down to the bottom of the message and below the text window you will see some buttons.

"Archive Conversation" will put in in your Archive so you can save it for later.

"Delete" will delete the message and once you do that, it will not ever come back. Just confirm you want it deleted and it will become history.
