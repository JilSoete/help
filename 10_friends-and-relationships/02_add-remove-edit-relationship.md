# How do I add/change/delete a relationship with someone else?

Adding, changing, and deleting a relationship with someone else on FetLife is easy (you're on your own for the real-life stuff)!

To edit or delete your relationships with someone else:

1. Click your nickname on the top-right side of FetLife and click "Edit Profile" in the dropdown menu.
2. Click the tab called "Relationships in".
3. The tab has two different types of relationships: "Relationships" and "D/s Relationships". You can add, edit, or delete those relationships on this screen. This only changes the relationships on *your* profile.

Please note, in order to have a relationship with someone, you have to be "friends" on FetLife first. Also, if you delete someone as a friend, any existing relationships with that person are deleted on both sides.

Believe it or not, there are some "friends" out there who say on their profile that they are in a relationship with you without your permission! Yeah, I know, that happens in real life too sometimes. There was this one... umm, that story is for another day...

But on FetLife there is something you can do about it! Go to that person's profile, and hover your mouse over the relationship with you. You'll notice a "x delete" link appear to the right. Click that to delete the relationship!
