# How do I add/delete a friend?

To add a friend, go to that person&rsquo;s profile and on the top right hand side of the profile, under the "Message Kinkster" button, you will see an "Add to My Friends" button. Click the button and a pop-up box will appear. Just read and follow the instructions and you should be good.

If you have the proper email notification setting turned on you will get an email when your friend accepts your friend request.

To delete a friend, go to that person&rsquo;s profile and on the top right hand side of the profile, under the "Message Kinkster" button, you will see an "We are Friends (x)" button. Click the "x", and your "friend" relationship will be terminated. Any relationship statuses you may have had with the person will be deleted as well (since you can only be in a relationship with a friend).

Blocking a person will also delete a "friend" relationship
