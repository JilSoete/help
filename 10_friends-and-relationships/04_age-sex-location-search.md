# Why can't I search by age/sex/etc?

Since FetLife is a social network and not a dating site, we've opted to not include search filters like that. I mean we probably have more hot members who are willing to take their clothes off than pretty much any other website out there... And it's all because we don't make it as easy to find them without some commonality. Obviously that's just one example of why we do what we do, but I hope you see where we're coming from. :-)

As a social network, we encourage people to get active in discussions, love pictures, and go out to events in your local area. There is a real kickass community here so have fun! Meeting people of a certain age/sex/cock or tit size/etc. will happen naturally when you are getting yourself out there.
