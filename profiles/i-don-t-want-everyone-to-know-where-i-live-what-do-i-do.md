# I don't want everyone to know where I live, what do I do?

What we recommend you do is choose a location far enough from you that you are comfortable with yet in your general area. If you really want to be off the radar you can always just specify your country as "Antarctica"... There are more kinksters than you would think living in Antarctica. And apparently the penguin population is getting very nervous... For the leather, you pervs, the leather!!!
