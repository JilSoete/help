# How do I put intro text about myself on my profile?

You know people want to know about you - come on, who wouldn't? To add text to your profile, click on your username in the header of any page on FetLife, and then on the "edit profile" link in the drop-down box.

On that page you will see several tabs, click on the one named "About You" and just start typing away. Once you have everything the way you want it, click the "Update" button and presto, the text will appear on your profile. Wash and repeat if you want to edit the text.
