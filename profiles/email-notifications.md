# Email Notifications

So the group that you joined is more than a bit overwhelming your email box with notifications. How the heck do you turn off those things?

You can do that in either of two ways.

Your global email notifications settings are in your "Update Settings" area of your profile. Click on your nickname in the upper right hand corner of the web page. A drop down box opens up, and then you click on "Update Settings". The "Email Notifications" tab has all of your email notifications in one place. Click On or Off as appropriate, and then on the "Update" button at the bottom of the screen.

In a particular group, in the upper right hand corner, you will see a little white checkbox that says "email notifications". When you join a group, you are subscribed to receive notifications of new discussions. Uncheck the checkbox to prevent receiving these notifications.

If you are still receiving notifications for a group that you are in, try two things:

A) Be patient - it can sometimes take up to 12 hours for the change to hit the email boxes if we are really swamped, and

B) Make sure that you aren't still signed up to receive that notification on a different profile... (Yeah, it happens a lot!)
