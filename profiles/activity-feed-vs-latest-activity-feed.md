# What? I have 2 feeds?

Yes, you do! There are actually 2 separate activity feeds running for everyone.

The first one is the activity you are doing yourself (commenting on posts and pictures, uploading writing, pics, and vids, etc) that shows up when anyone clicks on your profile or when you view your own profile as others see it.

The second one that you see when you click on the home page is your friends' activity, The only time you will see your name on this feed is if you comment on someone's status update.

All of your friends see when you upload a new picture and anyone who looks at your profile can see that as well.

If you have any other questions, please feel free to contact the caretakers at support@fetlife.com.
