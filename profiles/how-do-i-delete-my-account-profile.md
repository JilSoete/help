# How do I delete my account/profile?

What you mean you want to delete your account? That blows llama ass&hellip; and I know&hellip; I've blown&hellip; things&hellip; like balloons and such. But I digress.

The easiest way to delete your profile is to go to the [https://fetlife.com/deactivate?type=delete](https://fetlife.com/deactivate?type=delete "")link. Click on your nickname in the upper right hand part of your browser window. Then Click on &ldquo;Edit Profile&rdquo;. On the right hand side, you&rsquo;ll see a link to &ldquo;Delete profile&rdquo;. We ask you a few questions, and your profile goes "inactive" and into the queue to be deleted in seven days. Change your mind? No worries! Just log back into FetLife anytime in the next 7 days, and your profile becomes active and moves out of the delete queue!

Just remember, we will always be here for you. Don't hesitate to re-join in the future.
