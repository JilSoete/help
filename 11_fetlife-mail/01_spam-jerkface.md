# I can’t send any more messages, what is this Spam/Jerkface thing?

You’ve likely just joined the site and have been sending a lot of friend requests to people you know, sent a lot of messages, and/or commented on a lot of photos (to people who are not on your friends’ list yet). When this happens, the FetLife system puts you on a small timeout.

If this is the case, you have to wait a few hours and then try again and everything will be back to normal.

We know it can be annoying at times but we both hate spam and wankers and this is one way we keep FetLife from turning into a big ole spam and wank fest.
