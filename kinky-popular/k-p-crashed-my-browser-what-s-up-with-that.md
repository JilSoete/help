# K&P crashed my browser!  What's up with that?

Odds are, you've got an older computer - usually using an older browser - and it just can't take all the luscious, delectable, kinky.... oh wait, you crashed, that wasn't nice. Seriously, loading up to 5,000 different items on your computer can overload some older systems. And since we're not willing to cut back on the amount of Kinky & Popular Fet we're sending out to others, there are currently two choices:

1. Figure out how much your computer can handle - and don't go further down the screen than that.
2. Try updating your browser to the newest version or using a different browser. We recommend [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome "") or [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari "").
