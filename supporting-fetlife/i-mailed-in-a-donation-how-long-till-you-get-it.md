# I mailed in a donation, how long till you get it?

Depends on where you are mailing it from, it could take anywhere from 3 days to 2 weeks, sometimes a bit more, before we receive it. Once we receive the payment we enter it into the system and you are automatically notified via email that we have done so.

P.S. Thanks for your support. It means a lot to us!
