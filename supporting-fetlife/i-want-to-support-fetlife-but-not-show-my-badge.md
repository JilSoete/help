# I want to support FetLife, but not show my badge

So you love us and want to support us, but you don't want it to show on your profile that you do support us? No problem! You can hide your oh so spiffy support badge at any time and still enjoy all the premium benefits of supporting your favorite Kinky Social Networking site!

After you support us and your badge appears on your profile, just go to your nickname and click on it to access the drop down menu. From there, click on "Update Settings" and click on the last tab "Payments" You will see "settings" and a radio button to turn off the display of your Support FetLife badge, to ensure your privacy!
