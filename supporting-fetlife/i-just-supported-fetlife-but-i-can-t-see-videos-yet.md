# I just supported Fetlife, but I canâ€™t see videos yet.

First off, THANK YOU SO MUCH! Sorry about that though :( Very rarely the transaction does not go through properly but it happens. We can help though! If you look at your profile and don't see the sexy "I Support FetLife" badge on the right side of your profile near where the "Message Kinkster" buttonis after waiting 5 minutes, just email [support@fetlife.com](mailto:support@fetlife.com?subject=Support%20Did%20Not%20Go%20Through&body=My%20support%20for%20some%20reason%20did%20not%20go%20through.%20%20Here%20is%20my%20information%3A%0A%0A(Please%20fill%20out%20this%20form)%0ANickname%3A%20%0AAmount%20Paid%3A%0AMethod%20used%3A%20(i.e.%20ACH%2C%20Interac%2C%20Bitcoins%2C%20etc.)%0AMore%20info%3A "") and we will make it right in a jiffy.

If you do not see the badge on your profile, try emptying your cache, deleting any temporary files and/or folders and resetting the browser. Once refreshed, try again, and see if it is still happening. If it is, email [support@fetlife.com](mailto:support@fetlife.com?subject=Support%20Did%20Not%20Go%20Through&body=My%20support%20for%20some%20reason%20did%20not%20go%20through.%20%20Here%20is%20my%20information%3A%0A%0A(Please%20fill%20out%20this%20form)%0ANickname%3A%20%0AAmount%20Paid%3A%0AMethod%20used%3A%20(i.e.%20ACH%2C%20Interac%2C%20Bitcoins%2C%20etc.)%0AMore%20info%3A "") and we will fix you right up and get you perving with benefits in no time!
