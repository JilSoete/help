# How do I put intro text about myself on my profile?

You know people want to know about you - come on, who wouldn't?

To add text to your profile:

1. Click on your username in the header of any page on FetLife and click "Edit Profile" in the drop-down box.
2. Click the tab titled "About You".
3. Just start typing away. Once you have everything the way you want it, click the "Update" button and presto, the text will appear on your profile.

Rinse and repeat if you want to edit the text.
