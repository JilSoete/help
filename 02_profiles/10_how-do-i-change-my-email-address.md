# How do I change my email address?

So you want all your FetLife email to be going to a particular email address that is different than the one you signed up on, huh? No worries!

1. Click on the hamburger menu (icon with three horizontal lines) on the far right of FetLife's navigation bar.
2. Click on â€œUpdate Settings" in the pop out menu.
3. Click "Update" next to your email address under the Account tab.
