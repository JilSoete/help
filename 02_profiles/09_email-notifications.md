# Email Notifications

You can update your email notification settings in either of two ways.

Your global email notifications settings are in your "Update Settings" area of your profile:

1. Click your nickname in the upper-right corner of FetLife and select "Update Settings" from the dropdown menu.
2. The "Email Notifications" tab has all of your email notifications in one place. Click On or Off as appropriate.
3. Be sure to press the "Update" button at the bottom of the screen to save your changes!

When in the discussions tab of a FetLife Group, you will see a little white checkbox that says "email notifications". Check this box to start receiving email notifications from this group.

If you are still receiving notifications when you've opted out:

A) It can take some time for the change to hit the email boxes if we are really swamped.

B) Make sure that you aren't still signed up to receive that notification on a different profile... (Yeah, it happens a lot!)

If after 24 hours you are still receiving email notifications, you can contact the caretakers at [caretakers@fetlife.com](mailto:caretakers@fetlife.com) and they can help you out further. :-)
