# How do I delete my account/profile?

What you mean you want to delete your account? That blows llama ass... and I know... I've blown... things... like balloons and such. But I digress.

The easiest way to delete your profile is to go here: [https://fetlife.com/deactivate?type=delete](https://fetlife.com/deactivate?type=delete)

Alternatively, follow these steps to delete or deactivate your profile:
1. Click your nickname in the upper-right corner on any page on FetLife.
2. Click on "Edit Profile".
3. On the right side, you'll see a link to "Delete profile".

We ask you a few questions, and your profile goes "inactive" and into the queue to be deleted in seven days. Change your mind? No worries! Just log back into FetLife anytime in the next 7 days, and your profile becomes active and moves out of the delete queue!

Just remember, we will always be here for you. Don't hesitate to re-join in the future.
