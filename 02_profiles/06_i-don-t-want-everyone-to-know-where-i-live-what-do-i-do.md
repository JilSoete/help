# I don't want everyone to know where I live, what do I do?

We recommend you choose a location that is in your general area, but not specific to your current location.

If you really want to be off the radar you can always just specify your country as "Antarctica"... There are more kinksters than you would think living in Antarctica. And apparently the penguin population is getting very nervous... For the leather, you pervs, the leather!!!
