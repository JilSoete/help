# What is the Main Feed? What's Latest Activity?

Yes, you do! There are actually 2 separate activity feeds running for everyone.

The first one that you see when you click on the home page is your Main Feed which consists of your friends' activity, The only time you will see your name on this feed is if you comment on someone's status update.

The second one is the Latest Activity feed, the activity you are doing yourself (commenting on posts and pictures, uploading writing, pics, and vids, etc). This shows up when anyone clicks on your profile or when you view your own profile as others see it.

All of your friends see when you upload a new picture and anyone who looks at your profile can see that as well.
