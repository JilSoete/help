# How do I put intro text about myself on my profile?

You know people want to know about you - come on, who wouldn't?

To add text to your profile:

1. Click on the hamburger menu (icon with three horizontal lines) on the far right of FetLife's navigation bar.
2. Click "Edit Profile" in the pop out menu.
3. Click the tab titled "About You".
4. Just start typing away. Once you have everything the way you want it, click the "Update" button and presto, the text will appear on your profile.

Rinse and repeat if you want to edit the text.
