# Whatâ€™s a FetLife Warning?

We&rsquo;re glad you asked - because that must mean you don&rsquo;t have any yet, right? When someone violates FetLife rules, we usually will issue a FetLife warning. We are kind of naive, and actually believe that there is good in all of us. We really hope and believe that by giving people three chances (like strikes in baseball), that most will become good solid Fetizens. You know, the type that remember to turn over that 1% of their action to us...

Sadly, some do not. That&rsquo;s when we move to the next questions...
