# How do I block another Member?

Blocking another member is easy. There are two ways to do it.

1. Go to their profile. On the upper right side below the &ldquo;Message Kinkster&rdquo; and &ldquo;Add to My Friends&rdquo; rectangles, you will see two links - &ldquo;report user&rdquo; and &ldquo;block user&rdquo;. Click on &ldquo;block user&rdquo;, and through the wonders of artificial intelligence, they&rsquo;re blocked! To unblock them, click on the &ldquo;unblock user&rdquo; link.
2. If you are in a Private Message (PM) discussion with the person, on the right hand side of the screen there is a "Block user" link. You can click on it there to block the member. To unblock them, you have to go to their main profile as in 1.
