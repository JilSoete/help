# How do I add/change/delete a relationship with someone else?

Adding, changing and deleting a relationship with someone else on FetLife is easy (you're on your own for the real-life stuff!!!!) To edit or delete your relationships with someone else, click on your nickname in the upper right hand side of your browser window. That pops up a drop down box. Click on the "Edit Profile" link. From there, you'll see a tab in the middle marked "Relationships in". The tab has two different types of relationships: "Relationships" and "D/s Relationships". You can add, edit, or delete those relationships on this screen. This only changes the relationships in *your* profile.

Please note, in order to have a relationship with someone, you have to be "friends" on FetLife first before you can have a relationship "benefit". Also, if you delete someone as a friend, any existing relationships with that person are deleted on both sides.

Belive it or not, there are some "friends" out there who say on their profile that they are in a relationship with you without your permission! Yeah, I know, that happens in real life too sometimes. There was this one... umm, that story is for another day. But on FetLife there is something you can do about it! Go to that person's profile, and hover your mouse (the pointer, not the mouse itself...) over the relationship with you. You'll notice a "x delete" link appear to the right, and from there, you can delete the relationship!
