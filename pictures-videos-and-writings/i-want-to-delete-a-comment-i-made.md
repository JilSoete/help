# I want to delete a comment I made.

Unfortunately you can&rsquo;t delete a comment you made on someone else&rsquo;s picture, video, writing, status, or wall &ndash; but they can! So we suggest you contact the owner of the profile you commented on and ask them to remove your comment. If it was a comment you made in a group, you&rsquo;d have to contact the group owner to see if they will delete it for you.
