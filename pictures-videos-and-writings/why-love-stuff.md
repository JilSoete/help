# Why would I want to love stuff?

When you click on the "love" button, it helps you do a few different things.

First, when you love something, your friends will see it on their feeds so this is a way to share stuff with them.

Loving stuff also acts like a way of bookmarking your favourite pictures, videos, and writings. You can see all the stuff you loved in your "Stuff You Love" page (click on your nickname in the FetLife header and then "Stuff You Love").

Finally, having tons of people love something in a short period of time is the only way for it to get on Kinky & Popular so if you want something to get on K&P, you are voting for it with your love.
