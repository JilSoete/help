# How do I delete a picture or video I've uploaded?

Click the picture or video you want to delete to get the larger version of the picture or playable version of the video. From that page, click on the "delete" link that you will find to the right of the picture or video. Once you confirm you want to delete the file presto, it is gone, gone, gone...

If the picture is your avatar and it is the only picture, our system now allows you to delete it as well. Otherwise, you need to change your avatar to a different picture, then you can delete it.
