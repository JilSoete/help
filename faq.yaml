  IE 9 Webroot Antivirus incompatability: "<p>\r\n\tWe&#39;ve only had one report
    of this so far, but for the record:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tMember was using IE9.&nbsp;
    He reported that he was having problems upon login to Fetlife.&nbsp; After he
    began disabling plug-ins, he found that his Webroot Antivirus, FetLife began working
    correctly.</p>\r\n"
  IE 8 Compatability Issue with Friends Request: "<p>\r\n\tThe Fetlife development
    and caretaker teams both worked hard to come up with fixes to the Friends Request
    bug. Some of the hair lost there may never come back...</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe first
    fixes happened pretty quickly - Chrome, Internet Explorer (IE) 9, etc., were fixed
    in short order (hours) by the development team. That left reports on IE 7 and
    8. We don&#39;t support IE 7 - two versions of IE are difficult enough! But IE
    8 was trickier, because we couldn&#39;t replicate it. Some of our wonderful creative
    members found short-term work-a-rounds for the bug, and many of you helped out
    in sending in screen shots, support details and more. We love kinky bug killers,
    and you guys helped slaughter this one! (Electric bug zappers were not required
    in the crushing of this bug, and no actual insects were harmed...)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFinally,
    one of our intrepid caretakers, using all this input, found the issue - it was
    with members using IE8 in compatibility mode. We&#39;ve tested it with some of
    you, and this has solved the problem in all of those cases.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHere
    is what to do:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tHead over to your friend request page
    and you will see your the number of requests, but not the actual pending requests.</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tLook
    on your Internet Explorer browser and click on &quot;Tools&quot; and from the
    drop down menu over on the right, look at &quot;Compatibility View&quot; and see
    if there is a check mark besides it.</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tIf you see one, click
    on &quot;Compatibility View&quot; to remove the check mark and the page should
    refresh. It should show your pending friend requests now.</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tIf
    it didn&#39;t fix the problem, look down in the bottom left hand corner of the
    page and there should be a yellow box. Click on it and copy and paste the text
    into an email for us and we can look further into it for you.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n"

  Apple OS upgrade issues: "<p>\r\n\tA recent Apple OS update <i>(*cough cough*)</i>
    has caused a few settings to be changed on your Mac/Gadget (iPhone, iPad, etc.),
    which may be preventing you from logging into FetLife. To fix it, do the following:
    1) Open the browser on your Mac/Gadget. 2) Go to the Settings 3) Look for &quot;Allow
    Cookies&quot; and change it to &quot;Always Allow&quot;. While you&#39;re in the
    settings, clear your browser cache and history, then try logging in again. If
    you&#39;re still experiencing any problems, please contact support@fetlife.com</p>\r\n"
  How do @ notifications work?: "If someone posts on your profile you will get an
    @ notification at the top of your page and in your&nbsp;https://fetlife.com/ats
    page.<br />\r\n-This includes things like comments on your pics, vids, writings
    and wall.<br />\r\n-It also includes loves on your pics, vids and writings.<br
    />\r\n-It does NOT include any group comments, even if someone writes @yourname
    or replies to a group thread you started.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo why do people
    type @yourname in the first place? It just makes the conversation easier to follow
    if there are a bunch of people. For example:<br />\r\n@person1 I agree with you
    totally<br />\r\n@person2 You&#39;re dead wrong!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n@ing someone
    in a thread makes it clear who you are talking to but it does not give anyone
    a notification."
  Why did I get locked out?: "You&#39;ve tripped a trigger, and suddenly you&#39;re
    locked out of your profile with a Security message popping up! &nbsp;Why did this
    happen?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHere&#39;s the most common reasons members get locked
    out of their profiles for security reasons, and how to fix it to get you back
    among your pervy friends:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Your cat sat on the keyboard. &nbsp;Yeah,
    it happens!</li>\r\n\t<li>Your browser suddenly started reloading the same page
    again and again and again. &nbsp;It&#39;s a browser bug. &nbsp;We suggest you
    update the browser to it&#39;s latest version. &nbsp;If it&#39;s still happening,
    email support@fetlife.com.</li>\r\n\t<li>You have &quot;HoverZoom&quot; installed.
    &nbsp;HoverZoom doesn&#39;t play nice with FetLife - you have to actually uninstall
    it to stop the lockouts.</li>\r\n\t<li>Sometimes browser extensions and add-ons
    can be a bit over-eager and appear malicious. &nbsp;If you&#39;re getting locked
    out, we recommend uninstalling all your extensions and see if that stops it! &nbsp;Then
    you can add&nbsp;them back one by one.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n"
Profiles:
  How do I change my nickname?: "<p>You now&nbsp;have the ability to change your own
    nickname every 28 days! For your convenience, click <a href=\"https://fetlife.com/users/edit_nickname\"
    target=\"_blank\">here</a>. Otherwise click on your nickname at the top of the
    browser window. Click on &ldquo;Edit Profile&rdquo; in the drop down box. The
    second tab from the left is &ldquo;Change Nickname&rdquo;. Remember, please make
    sure that your new nickname is between 2 and 16 alphanumeric characters (letters
    and numbers) and does not consist of any spaces or periods (dashes and underscores
    are ok though) - our computers scream &quot;RED&quot; on spaces!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You
    should also check to see if anyone on the site is already using the nickname you
    want. A quick way to do this is to type in http://fetlife.com/usernameYOUwant
    in the URL bar. &nbsp;If there is someone with that username, it will bring them
    up. &nbsp;Otherwise it will take you to your activity feed.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>http://fetlife.com/johnbaku</li>\r\n\t<li>http://fetlife.com/SurelyNobodyHasThisNickname</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Note:
    If you don&#39;t want to wait the 28 days, the caretakers can still change your
    nickname for you at any time, just make sure to email them from the email address
    attached to your profile, mention your current nickname and desired nickname so
    they can do it for you.</p>\r\n"
  How do I delete my account/profile?: "<p>\r\n\tWhat you mean you want to delete
    your account? That blows llama ass&hellip; and I know&hellip; I&#39;ve blown&hellip;
    things&hellip; like balloons and such. But I digress.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe easiest
    way to delete your profile is to go to the &nbsp;<a href=\"https://fetlife.com/deactivate?type=delete\">https://fetlife.com/deactivate?type=delete</a>&nbsp;link.
    &nbsp;Click on your nickname in the upper right hand part of your browser window.
    &nbsp;Then Click on &ldquo;Edit Profile&rdquo;. &nbsp;On the right hand side,
    you&rsquo;ll see a link to &ldquo;Delete profile&rdquo;. &nbsp;We ask you a few
    questions, and your profile goes &quot;inactive&quot; and into the queue to be
    deleted in seven days. &nbsp;Change your mind? &nbsp;No worries! &nbsp;Just log
    back into FetLife anytime in the next 7 days, and your profile becomes active
    and moves out of the delete queue!</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&nbsp;Just
    remember, we will always be here for you. Don&#39;t hesitate to re-join in the
    future.</p>\r\n"
  Can I deactivate my profile instead of deleting it?: Feel the need for a vacation
    from Kink? &nbsp; Need to go invisible for a bit, but not delete your profile?
    &nbsp;FetLife has you covered! &nbsp;When you go to the&nbsp;<a href="https://fetlife.com/deactivate"_blank">https://fetlife.com/deactivate</a>&nbsp;to
    delete your account, you have the choice to deactivate it instead! &nbsp;That
    way you can make it so that no one can view your account or send you messages,
    and you can come back to the same profile at a later date. &nbsp;I wish that would
    work with, well, work...
  How do I put intro text about myself on my profile?: "<p>\r\n\tYou know people want
    to know about you - come on, who wouldn&#39;t? To add text to your profile, click
    on your username in the header of any page on FetLife, and then on the &quot;edit
    profile&quot; link in the drop-down box.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tOn that page you
    will see several tabs, click on the one named &quot;About You&quot; and just start
    typing away. Once you have everything the way you want it, click the &quot;Update&quot;
    button and presto, the text will appear on your profile. Wash and repeat if you
    want to edit the text.</p>\r\n"
  My location isn't on your list, what do I do?: "<p>\r\n\tCurrently, the list of
    locations only includes actual cities (don&#39;t shoot the messenger). We realize
    this is annoying and we need to fix it. However, we cannot fix the problem without
    overhauling the whole thing, so in the meantime, if your location is not listed,
    please pick the closest city to you until we can get and integrate a more thorough
    list of locations. Sorry for the inconvenience :(</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmen_Sandiego\"
    target=\"_blank\">Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?</a>; boy do I miss that
    game.</p>\r\n"
  I don't want everyone to know where I live, what do I do?: "<p>What we recommend
    you do is choose a location far enough from you that you are comfortable with
    yet in your general area. If you really want to be off the radar you can always
    just specify your country as &quot;Antarctica&quot;... There are more kinksters
    than you would think living in Antarctica. And apparently the penguin population
    is getting very nervous... For the leather, you pervs, the leather!!!</p>"
  Does FetLife allow multiple profiles?: "<p>\r\n\tYes, FetLife allows people to have
    multiple profiles. &nbsp;For example, MeanUberDom might have a secret fantasy
    about being spanked, and doesn&#39;t feel comfortable letting all his friends
    know - so he creates a secondary (also called alternate) profile called PlsSpankMeMommy
    to explore this side of his sexuality. &nbsp;His pictures there might not be of
    himself (but of course, still copy-right compliant!). &nbsp;The information about
    age and such changed to help him feel comfortable and not judged by others. &nbsp;But
    it is still the sort of profile allowed on FetLife.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThere are
    some types of alternate profiles that we do not allow. &nbsp;For example:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tSock
    Puppets -&nbsp;&nbsp;alternate or secondary profiles that are used to go around
    blocks, bans, or spoof or maliciously attack other members of FetLife. &nbsp;When
    reported and verified, we wash those socks right out of FetLife!</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tImpostors
    - someone posing as another real person. &nbsp;As soon as the real person says
    &quot;Not Cool!&quot;, we delete the profile.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n"
  How do I make a secondary profile?: "<div>Simple! &nbsp;You make it the same way
    you made your first profile.&nbsp; However, please note that FetLife requires
    a unique:<br />\r\n&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>email address</li>\r\n\t<li>nickname</li>\r\n\t<li>phone
    number (if using SMS verification)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n"
  Email Notifications: "So the group that you joined is more than a bit overwhelming
    your email box with notifications. &nbsp;How the heck do you turn off those things?<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can do that in either of two ways.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour
    global email notifications settings are in your &quot;Update Settings&quot; area
    of your profile. &nbsp;Click on your nickname in the upper right hand corner of
    the web page. &nbsp;A drop down box opens up, and then you click on &quot;Update
    Settings&quot;. &nbsp;The &quot;Email Notifications&quot; tab has all of your
    email notifications in one place. &nbsp;Click On or Off as appropriate, and then
    on the &quot;Update&quot; button at the bottom of the screen.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn
    a particular group, in the upper right hand corner, you will see a little white
    checkbox that says &quot;email notifications&quot;. When you join a group, you
    are subscribed to receive notifications of new discussions. Uncheck the checkbox
    to prevent receiving these notifications.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you are
    still receiving notifications for a group that you are in, try two things:<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nA) Be patient - it can sometimes take up to 12 hours for the change
    to hit the email boxes if we are really swamped, and<br />\r\n<br />\r\nB) Make
    sure that you aren&#39;t still signed up to receive that notification on a different
    profile... &nbsp;(Yeah, it happens a lot!)\r\n"
  How do I change my email address?: So you want all your FetLife email to be going
    to a particular email address that is different than the one you signed up on,
    huh? &nbsp;No worries, mon! &nbsp;Click on your nickname in the upper right hand
    portion of your browser window, then click on &quot;Update Settings&quot;. &nbsp;The
    tab with your email address should be the one that opens up. &nbsp;Click on Update,
    and its a wrap. &nbsp;Unless you are into sandwiches instead...
  What? I have 2 feeds?: "<div>\r\n\tYes, you do! There are actually 2 separate activity
    feeds running for everyone.</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\tThe
    first one is the activity you are doing yourself (commenting on posts and pictures,
    uploading writing, pics, and vids, etc) that shows up when anyone clicks on your
    profile or when you view your own profile as others see it.</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\tThe
    second one that you see when you click on the home page is your friends&#39; activity,
    &nbsp;The only time you will see your name on this feed is if you comment on someone&#39;s
    status update.</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\tAll of your friends
    see when you upload a new picture and anyone who looks at your profile can see
    that as well.</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\tIf you have any other
    questions, please feel free to contact the caretakers at support@fetlife.com.</div>\r\n"
Pictures, Videos, and Writings:
  How do I upload a picture to my profile?: "<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\r\n\tEasy-peasy!
    Click on your nickname at the top of the page (towards the right hand side to
    bring up the handy drop down menu) and then on &quot;Upload Pictures&quot;.</p>\r\n<div>\r\n\tNow
    click on &quot;Choose File&quot;, find the picture that you want to upload on
    your computer, select it, and hit the appropriate button in the file dialog -
    depending on your browser and language that might be &quot;Save&quot;, &quot;Open&quot;,
    &quot;Grzblng&quot;, ... the one that doesn&rsquo;t say &quot;Cancel&quot;.</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\tYou
    can enter a caption as well if you want to, and you can make sure that only your
    friends see the picture by clicking on the &quot;change&quot; link in the &quot;Privacy&quot;
    line and selecting &quot;Just Friends&quot; from the dropdown list, or if you
    want this picture to be your main profile picture, check that &quot;Avatar&quot;
    checkbox. No, you can only have &quot;Just Friends&quot; or &quot;Avatar&quot;,
    not both at the same time. Don&rsquo;t be greedy!</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\t&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\tNow
    hit that &quot;Upload Picture&quot; button, have a bit of patience, get redirected
    to your newly uploaded picture. Purty, innit?</div>\r\n"
  How do I upload a picture or video to FetLife from my phone?: "<p>\r\n\tYes, you
    can upload pics to your FetLife profile from your phone!</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHow so?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tVia
    email of course! Each one of you will be assigned a unique email address that
    you can use to email in pictures on the go to your FetLife profile. Just copy
    the address to your phone&#39;s address book, and then anytime you are balls deep
    in that bitch&#39;s ass and want to share some action stills with us - you can!
    :-)</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tYou can upload more then one picture at a time by just attaching
    multiple pics to the email. Something you can&#39;t even do from the website.
    Subject == Picture Caption. Just write the picture caption in the subject line.
    Easy cheesy.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSome things you should know:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tThere
    is a 25MB limit on email size right. Depending on your phone, you should be good
    to send 5-10 pics in one email.</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tFor security reasons, you
    need to send the email from the email address that is associated to your FetLife
    account. We wouldn&#39;t want just anyone posting pics to your profile would you!
    I didn&#39;t think so! :-p</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tVideos can&#39;t be uploaded
    directly, so feel free to send them to us for us to watch... I mean, to load for
    you!</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tThe address you upload FROM has to be the one you used
    to sign up for the site. The address you upload TO is shown on your &quot;upload
    a pic&quot; page</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tIf you&#39;re having problems, you can
    just email any pictures or videos you want posted on your profile to support@fetlife.com,
    and we will post them for you!</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tIn the Subject line of the
    email, if you start with &quot;Private:&quot;, the picture will be posted as Friends
    Only. &nbsp;If you start with &quot;Avatar:&quot;, it will be set as your avatar.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n"
  Can I set my Pictures, Videos, or Writing to Friends only?: "<p>Yes, you can! &nbsp;If
    you would like to make any of the Pictures, Videos or Writings you have uploaded
    here to FetLife, it&#39;s easy as pie and pie is good!</p><p>Anything you upload
    to FetLife defaults to the privacy setting &quot;FetLifers&quot; meaning everyone
    on FetLife who stumbles upon it can see it, unless you select the Privacy setting
    before uploading it.</p><p>If you would like to change it so that only those in
    your list of friends can see the picture, video or writing, look over on the right
    hand side partway down the page to find &quot;PRIVACY&quot; &nbsp;Click on text
    link &quot;edit&quot; and select &quot;Just Friends&quot; and now only those who
    are in your friend&#39;s list can see it!</p>"
  I am getting a "Content type" error when uploading a picture - what formats are allowed?: "<p>\r\n\tMake
    sure the file extension of your picture is either: jpg, jpeg, gif, png or pjpeg.
    We accept gifs but we don&#39;t accept animated gifs, or bitmap images (.bmp).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIf
    you can&#39;t figure out what the problem is send an email to support@fetlife.com
    with the image attached. &nbsp;That way we can look into it for you, help find
    out what&rsquo;s happening, and get you on your way to picture upload nirvana.</p>\r\n"
  How can I add or edit the caption on a picture or video I've already uploaded?: "<p>\r\n\tTo
    add or edit a caption on a picture or a video that you&rsquo;ve already uploaded,
    you follow a similar process. Click on the picture or video, which will enlarge
    the picture or take you to the playable video. Under the picture or video, you
    will see an &quot;edit&quot; link. Click &quot;edit&quot; and add or edit your
    caption. That&rsquo;s it!</p>\r\n"
  Can I re-order my pictures or videos, or put them into folders?: "<p>\r\n\tCurrently,
    you can&#39;t organize or re-order your pictures. We might offer the ability to
    do so in the future though. John is offering to do it especially for you for the
    low, low price of one full-time kinky Rails programmer...</p>\r\n"
  How do I delete a picture or video I've uploaded?: "<p>\r\n\tClick the picture or
    video you want to delete to get the larger version of the picture or playable
    version of the video. From that page, click on the &quot;delete&quot; link that
    you will find to the right of the picture or video. Once you confirm you want
    to delete the file presto, it is gone, gone, gone...</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIf the picture
    is your avatar and it is the only picture, our system now allows you to delete
    it as well. &nbsp;Otherwise, you need to change your avatar to a different picture,
    then you can delete it.</p>\r\n"
  How do I embed a video?: "<p>It doesn&#39;t actually take any great programming
    talent to embed a video into your writing or group post. Hell, even John did it!</p><p>In
    your message, leave a blank line between your text and the link to the video you
    want to embed, and a blank line afterwards. Don&#39;t write on the line with the
    link. That&#39;s all!!!</p><p>For example, this will work:</p><p><span style=\"font-size:
    13px;\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaXLtPGrTGQ</span></p><p>This will not:</p><p>Here
    is another test https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaXLtPGrTGQ</p><p>Embedded video
    only works for Writings and Group initial posts for now, not in comments.</p><p>Please
    note you need to use the WATCH link, not the EMBED link from youtube.</p>\r\n"
  Can I embed a picture in a writing?: "<p>\r\n\tYes you can, as long as it is already
    on FetLife! &nbsp;Just put in the link as a separate line, and the picture will
    be embedded in your writing.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHere&#39;s an example of an embedded
    picture in a writing:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fetlife.com/users/1/posts/845098\"
    target=\"_blank\">https://fetlife.com/users/1/posts/845098</a><br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe
    way this was typed into the writing was as follows:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWell... her
    and her man... but SBS is kind of hotter then @tatted_tater.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tCheck
    out what they posted:</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\thttps://fetlife.com/users/632624/pictures/8485136</p>\r\n"
  How do I edit or delete my Writing?: "Got some second thoughts on that piece of
    prose you posted? &nbsp;All it takes to edit or delete it is a few simple steps.
    Click on the writing you want to edit or delete. &nbsp;Look on the right side
    of the page. You&#39;ll see a text link to edit the writing and just below that,
    another one to delete the writing. Just click on the appropriate link, confirm
    you want it saved or deleted, and it will be done.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you want
    to add extra features to your writings, such as underlines, bold, different sized
    fonts, etc., check out the formatting guidelines at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fetlife.com/formatting_guidelines\"
    target=\"_blank\">https://fetlife.com/formatting_guidelines</a>."
  I want to delete a comment I made.: Unfortunately you can&rsquo;t delete a comment
    you made on someone else&rsquo;s picture, video, writing, status, or wall &ndash;
    but they can! So we suggest you contact the owner of the profile you commented
    on and ask them to remove your comment. If it was a comment you made in a group,
    you&rsquo;d have to contact the group owner to see if they will delete it for
    you.
  Why would I want to love stuff?: "When you click on the &quot;love&quot; button,
    it helps you do a few different things.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFirst, when you love
    something, your friends will see it on their feeds so this is a way to share stuff
    with them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLoving stuff also acts like a way of bookmarking
    your favourite pictures, videos, and writings. You can see all the stuff you loved
    in your &quot;Stuff You Love&quot; page (click on your nickname in the FetLife
    header and then &quot;Stuff You Love&quot;).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFinally, having
    tons of people love something in a short period of time is the only way for it
    to get on Kinky &amp; Popular so if you want something to get on K&amp;P, you
    are voting for it with your love."
  Is my picture's metadata safe?: 'We love privacy as much as we like spanking. So
    when you upload your hot ass pictures we will automatically strip the metadata.
    #privacy #stripping'
Groups:
  How do I change my group's name?: "<p>\r\n\tSimple, if you are the group&#39;s owner,
    just email the caretakers at support@fetlife.com from the email address you use
    for FetLife and include the following in your email:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tLink
    to the group:</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tCurrent name of group:</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tNew
    Name:</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n"
  How do I join/leave a group?: "<p>\r\n\tTo join a group, you first have to find
    a group you are interested in joining. There are three ways to find groups that
    catch your attention:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t<a href=\"https://fetlife.com/groups/most_popular\"
    target=\"_blank\">Browse our Most Popular Groups</a>;</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\t<a
    href=\"https://fetlife.com/search/groups\" target=\"_blank\">Search for groups
    by keyword</a>;</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tCheck out what groups your friends are members
    of.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOnce you find a group you are interested in joining
    click the &quot;Join Group&quot; link just below the group&#39;s name. Then read
    over the group&#39;s description, rules and restrictions and if you still feel
    the group is for you then click the &quot;Join this Group&quot; button.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhat
    if the group is not for you anymore? No problem, within the group itself and just
    under the group name, you&rsquo;ll see a link to &quot;leave group&quot;. Click
    on the link, confirm you want to leave the group and presto, you are no longer
    a member of the group.</p>\r\n"
  How do I delete a new discussion I started in a group?: "<p>To have a post or comment
    in a group deleted you will have to contact one of the group leaders to remove
    it for you. The removal of a post or comment will be up to the discretion of the
    group leaders, so before posting make sure you do what my mother still tells me
    to this day - &quot;Think twice before you open your mouth&quot; (or type on the
    keyboard, in this case)!</p>"
  How do I follow a thread?: "<p>\r\nWhen you start a new or comment on a discussion
    you are automatically set to start following the thread. The threads you are already
    following are listed on your groups page and are updated when new comments are
    made to the discussion.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nTo stop or start following a thread, look
    just under the original post in the thread and click &quot;start following&quot;
    or &quot;stop following&quot;.</p>\r\n"
  How do I start my own group?: "<p>\r\n\tYou can just create a new group <a href=\"http://fetlife.com/groups/new\"
    target=\"_blank\">here</a>. But for future reference, you can always find a &quot;create
    new group&quot; link on the Groups home page right below the list of your groups.</p>\r\n"
  How can I add or remove group leaders?: "<p>\r\n\tIf you are a group owner, click
    on the &quot;Members&quot; tab in the group and search for the user you want to
    add or remove as a group leader from the group.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOnce you find
    them click on the &quot;moderate &or;&quot; button next to them. From that drop
    down menu you will be able to add or remove the user as a group leader.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t<em>Note:
    only one user can be a group owner, but you can have many group leaders.</em></p>\r\n"
  How do I remove or ban a user from my group?: "<p>\r\n\tIf you are a group leader,
    there are two ways you can ban a user from your group.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe first
    option is to click on the &quot;Members&quot; tab in the group and search for
    the user you want to remove or ban from the group.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOnce you find
    them click on the &quot;moderate &or;&quot; button next to them. From that drop
    down menu you will be able to remove or ban them from your group.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tAlternatively,
    a group leader can ban a member right from a comment that they made. To the right
    of each member&#39;s name, there is a link that says &quot;options&quot;. Click
    on that, and the options &quot;delete&quot;, &quot;ban&quot;, and &quot;close&quot;
    pop up. Click on &quot;ban&quot;, and the user is banned from your group.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIf
    you remove a user from the group, all of their posts will remain in the group.
    If you need to moderate a recently banned member&#39;s posts, you will have to
    do that separately from banning them.</p>\r\n"
  How do I ban someone from my group if they've already left?: "<p>\r\n\tIf someone
    has a comment in your group and then left, you can still ban them from your group.
    &nbsp;&nbsp;From their post in the group, you&#39;ll see a link called &quot;options&quot;.
    Click on that, and you&#39;ll see that you can ban the person right at the comment
    itself - even if they are no longer with your group.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIf there
    are no comments left in your group, you can contact <a href=\"mailto:support@fetlife.com\">support@fetlife.com</a>
    and ask one of the caretakers to do this for you.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhen you email
    the caretakers you should take advantage of the opportunity and report the user
    you want to ban from your group.</p>\r\n"
  I don't want to be a group leader anymore, what should I do?: "<p>Hey, it can take
    a lot of time &amp; energy to be the Big Daddy/Mommy! &nbsp;If you are a group
    owner, you should first click on the &quot;Members&quot; tab and give ownership
    of the group to one of the other group leaders or to someone you think would make
    a good group owner.&nbsp;</p>"
  How do I make a thread sticky?: "<p>\r\n\tWell, John has his own special way to
    make sticky threads, but we won&#39;t go into that here... For the rest of us,
    a<span class=\"Apple-style-span\">&nbsp;sticky thread is a thread posted at the
    top of the &quot;Discussions&quot; tab in each group. It is usually a thread that
    the group owner feels is important enough to keep at the top for easy reference.
    For example, it might be a list of FAQs for that group, or it might be the most
    popular thread that the group owner wants to remain visible no matter how many
    new discussions are started.</span></p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIf you are a group owner or
    leader just click on the discussion you want to make sticky and just below the
    original post it you will see several options. Click on the &quot;make sticky&quot;
    link and you got yourself a new sticky! Go check for yourself.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo
    make it &quot;unsticky&quot; just click on the sticky thread and below the original
    post click on the &quot;make unsticky&quot; link.</p>\r\n"
  How do I unembed a video in my group?: "Youtube video embedding is fun! &nbsp;But,
    with the proliferation of Youtube videos being posted in groups, some group owners
    have asked us &quot;What do we do if there are minors in the videos?&quot;. &nbsp;The
    answer is quite simple - all you have to do in unembed the video, &nbsp;since
    links to pictures or videos with non-sexualized images of minors is ok. &nbsp;This
    leaves the link and the discussion in place, but removes the video from FetLife
    itself.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll you have to do is add the word &quot;UNEMBED&quot;
    on the same line before the link. &nbsp;For example:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch....\"
    style=\"padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left:
    0px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px;
    color: rgb(0, 126, 255); font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;
    line-height: 19px; text-align: left; vertical-align: baseline; border-top-width:
    0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px;
    border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style:
    initial; outline-color: initial; background: inherit; \" target=\"_blank\">http://www.youtube.com/watch</a>........
    - puts in an embedded video<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUNEMBED&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch....\"
    style=\"padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left:
    0px; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px;
    color: rgb(0, 126, 255); font-family: 'Lucida Grande', Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;
    line-height: 19px; text-align: left; vertical-align: baseline; border-top-width:
    0px; border-right-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px;
    border-style: initial; border-color: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style:
    initial; outline-color: initial; background: inherit; \" target=\"_blank\">http://www.youtube.com/watch</a>....
    - takes out the embedding"
  The "mod" banned me from the group - what can I do about it?: "One of the beauties
    of FetLife&#39;s structure (I know, bad word for pseudo-anarchists like us!) is
    that there is always an alternative to a group owner or leader banning you from
    a group.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCreate your own group.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile we
    give group owners and leaders considerable power in deciding group membership,
    it&#39;s countered by the ability to create your own group about the same subject
    if you wish. &nbsp;Group owners and leaders who go megalomaniacal (whew - fingers
    tired after that one!) often find their group members voting with their feet -
    off to another group. &nbsp;Democracy in action, baby!"
  How do I follow a discussion in a group?: Look right under the OP (Original Post)
    in each discussion - there is a link that says &quot;Start following&quot; the
    discussion. &nbsp;And you get notified whenever someone else adds their sparkling
    words of wisdom!
  How do I delete my group?: "First off, we&#39;d suggest not deleting your group,
    but handing it off to another member of the group. &nbsp;But if you are absolutely,
    positively, 100% sure you want to delete a group that you own, there are two ways.
    &nbsp;You can either:\r\n<p>\r\n\tA) delete all the members (including any that
    are banned) and delete yourself last, or</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tB) ask the caretakers
    at support@fetlife.com to wave their magic cane and delete it for you.<br />\r\n\t<br
    />\r\n\tAs long as they use the right &quot;cane&quot;, it will be gone!</p>\r\n"

How can I protect myself on FetLife?:
  How do I block another Member?: "<p>\r\n\tBlocking another member is easy. &nbsp;
    There are two ways to do it.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tGo
    to their profile. &nbsp;On the upper right side below the &ldquo;Message Kinkster&rdquo;
    and &ldquo;Add to My Friends&rdquo; rectangles, you will see two links - &ldquo;report
    user&rdquo; and &ldquo;block user&rdquo;. &nbsp;Click on &ldquo;block user&rdquo;,
    and through the wonders of artificial intelligence, they&rsquo;re blocked! &nbsp;To
    unblock them, click on the &ldquo;unblock user&rdquo; link.</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tIf
    you are in a Private Message (PM) discussion with the person, on the right hand
    side of the screen there is a &quot;Block user&quot; link. &nbsp;You can click
    on it there to block the member. &nbsp;To unblock them, you have to go to their
    main profile as in 1.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n"
  What does a block do?: "<p>When you block a member, they won&#39;t be able to see
    any part of your profile. &nbsp;&nbsp;John has been trying to make this feature
    for mothers-in-law but no luck so far :-)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blocks also changes any
    past interchanges between you and the other person. &nbsp;That means it archives
    any private messages. &nbsp;It deletes any wall posts, etc. &nbsp;If you were
    friends, the block eliminates that. &nbsp;It eliminates any relationship statuses
    between the two of you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blocks won&rsquo;t prevent people seeing
    your comments in groups, other people&#39;s walls, pictures, writings, etc. &nbsp;It
    only just blocks the items on your profile. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the
    blocked person makes an alternate profile to contact you around that block, that&rsquo;s
    called a &ldquo;sock puppet&rdquo;. &nbsp;Notify the FetLife Caretakers, and they&rsquo;ll
    investigate. &nbsp;If discovered, the sock puppet is deleted and the member warned.</p>\r\n"
  Who have I blocked?: "<p>Want to review the profiles that you&rsquo;ve blocked?</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Go
    to &ldquo;Update Settings&rdquo;, located in the drop down box under your profile
    name at the top right&nbsp;of your screen.&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Click on the tab&nbsp;<a
    href=\"https://fetlife.com/settings/blocked\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">&ldquo;Blocked
    List&rdquo;</a>.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>You&rsquo;ll see all the profiles you&#39;ve
    currently blocked from your profile on FetLife.</p>\r\n"
  How do I unblock someone?: "<p>Making up is hard to do - but unblocking them is
    easy!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From your <a href=\"http://fetlife.com/settings/blocked\"
    target=\"_blank\">Blocked List</a>, just click on &ldquo;unblock&rdquo; under
    the profile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not as hot as makeup sex, but it&rsquo;s easier!</p>\r\n"
  What can I do if someone is following me everywhere in FetLife (Restraining Order)?: "<p>If
    you&#39;ve blocked someone, but they seemingly follow you into groups, respond
    always after you do, etc., it might be time to request a FetLife Restraining Order
    (ROs). ROs are a two-way street (because hey, relationships are two-ways streets,
    right?). Each person in an RO is requested, from that point on, to cease speaking
    of (directly or indirectly), to, or about one another in the public areas of FetLife.
    In effect, we ask that each person pretty much &#39;pretend&#39; that the other
    person does not exist on the site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will also request that each
    person remove any other posts on FetLife about one another. If we come across
    any ourselves, we will remove them without notification or a warning (if they
    are from the past), and WITH notification and a warning (if they are from this
    point forward).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If this FetLife Restraining Order is violated in
    any shape or form, or if either person tries to circumvent it, a warning will
    be issued. &nbsp;If the behavior continues, someone may be removed and banned
    from the site. We really hate to do that, but we hope that by creating this restraining
    order, everybody can get back to enjoying FetLife - which is the real reason we&rsquo;re
    all here! (Well, that and to perv on those pics, videos, etc....)</p>\r\n"
  What’s a FetLife Warning?: "<p>We&rsquo;re glad you asked - because that must mean
    you don&rsquo;t have any yet, right? &nbsp;When someone violates FetLife rules,
    we usually will issue a FetLife warning. &nbsp;We are kind of naive, and actually
    believe that there is good in all of us. &nbsp;We really hope and believe that
    by giving people three chances (like strikes in baseball), that most will become
    good solid Fetizens. &nbsp;You know, the type that remember to turn over that
    1% of their action to us...</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSadly, some do not. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s
    when we move to the next questions...</p>\r\n"
  What’s a “Time-Out”?: "<p>\r\n\tSometimes, a FetLife member just seems to be caught
    up in the rush of emotions that can sometimes result because of living on Internet
    time. When we feel it is warranted, we may place a member on &quot;Time Out&quot;.
    Essentially, what we&#39;re asking a member to do is to step back and re-evaluate
    what is going on, because often our only other option is to delete their profile
    and ban them from the site. During a Time Out, a member is not allowed to do anything
    other than private messages on FetLife. Basically anything that would show on
    your activity feed (including editing your profile), or the creation or use of
    alternate accounts to get around the time out, is prohibited.</p>\r\n"
  What’s a FetLife Ban?: "<p>When warnings, Restraining Orders, and Time-Outs don&#39;t
    work, we sadly have to consider banning a member from the site. &nbsp;Even here,
    we try for a measured approach. &nbsp;We&#39;ll ban someone from FetLife for a
    period of time. &nbsp;If they violate the ban, we may opt to extend it, and at
    times make it permanent.</p>"
  Why won't you ban their IP?: We get this question a lot in reference to other members
    behaving badly. &nbsp;Sadly, blocking an IP address doesn&#39;t work. It is a
    common Internet myth, based back on the days when people had static IP addresses.
    Almost everyone today has a dynamic IP address. Each time you connect to your
    local Internet Service Provider, you will usually get a new IP address. For example,
    when describing this to one member, during the 6 months they had been on FetLife,
    they had used over 850 IP addresses! &nbsp;And over three-fourths of those IP
    addresses have been also used by other FetLife members at some time, most of them
    by over 20 other FetLife members. &nbsp;
  I'm scared for my life - in real life!: "### ***CALL THE COPS!***<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf
    you have a real life stalker, an abusive ex, a crazy person who decided that your
    online disagreements require physical confrontation, call the police now, not
    later! &nbsp;Don&#39;t worry about FetLife being &quot;outted&quot; - we work
    with law enforcement around the globe on a frequent basis. &nbsp;If there is stuff
    happening on FetLife that relates to that, tell them, and have them contact us
    at support@fetlife.com. &nbsp;We know, law enforcement is not the same all over,
    and what works great in one place may not do so well the next jurisdiction over
    - but that *is* what they are there for - you know, the whole &quot;Protect and
    Serve&quot; thing!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSeriously - our reach extends as far as
    this system. &nbsp;A few kinksters scattered around the globe can do wonders when
    it comes to an online social network, but we can&#39;t replace the role of the
    police and legal system. &nbsp;If the other person is vandalizing your car, causing
    a scene at your munch, stalking you at work, etc., you need physical, on-the-ground
    support!"
Login Issues:
  How do I change my password?: "<p>\r\n\tOnce you are logged in you can change your
    password from the settings section.. A link to it is found in FetLife&#39;s header
    on the right hand side in the drop-down under your nickname. Click on your nickname,
    then on &quot;Update Settings&quot;, then on the &quot;Change Password&quot; tab.</p>\r\n"
  I forgot my password! What can I do?: "<p>You can reset your password by going to
    our <a href=\"https://fetlife.com/users/password/new\" target=\"_blank\">retrieve
    login information form</a> and submitting your email address attached to your
    account. Once you do that we will send you an email with instructions on how you
    can reset your password.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Make sure you check your junk mail and
    spam filter because sometimes FetLife mail gets caught up in there. If that does
    not work for you don&#39;t hesitate to email <a href=\"mailto:support@fetlife.com?subject=Retrieve%20Login%20information\">support@fetlife.com</a>.</p>\r\n"
  I've already signed up to FetLife but I can't remember my nickname.: "<p>\r\n\tIf
    you remember the email address and password you used to sign-up to FetLife you
    can login using your email address instead of your nickname and you can just check
    out your profile to see what your nickname is.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIf you can&#39;t
    remember your password follow the instructions to reset your password in the previous
    article <a href=\"https://fetlife.com/help/7#assistly_article_39\">above</a>.</p>\r\n"
  Why can't you just send me my password?: "<p>\r\n\tWe don&#39;t store passwords
    in plain text format like many sites do. All passwords are encrypted in the database
    that even the FetLife gods themselves cannot decipher. We do this because your
    security, and ours, is important to us!</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tWhat we can do is send
    you a temporary password to allow you to log in and change it yourself! &nbsp;(We&#39;re
    all about the do-it-yourself thing - that&#39;s why John falls asleep with a bottle
    of lube in his hand...). &nbsp;Send ua an email to <a href=\"mailto:support@fetlife.com?subject=Send%20me%20a%20temporary%20password!&amp;body=Help!%20%20I've%20forgotten%20my%20password%20and%20I%20can't%20perv%20FetLife%20without%20it!!%20%20Please%20sen%20me%20a%20temprary%20password%20so%20I%20can%20get%20my%20kink%20on%20again!!\">support@fetlife.com</a>.</p>\r\n"
  I can't login and I don't have access to my email address associated to my profile.: "<p>\r\n\tSend
    an email to <a href=\"mailto:support@fetlife.com\">support@fetlife.com</a> with
    your nickname, old email address and we will see what kind of voodoo magic we
    can work for you. No promises though!</p>\r\n"
  What is a good password?: "<p>\r\n\tHow do I create an easy to remember but hard
    to guess password?</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tHere are two possible ways:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\thttp://xkcd.com/936/</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tThink
    of a sentence that means something to you and use the first letter of each word
    to create the password. Preserve punctuation, add in a number or special character,
    et voil&agrave; (that&#39;s Greek and means &quot;oh, look, a shiny!&quot;).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTake
    for example &quot;The big John Baku jumps over the lazy James Lennon at FetLife,
    eating two hotdogs&quot; - you can convert it to &quot;TbJBjotlJL@F,e2h&quot;.
    Complete gibberish, eh? But actually if you remember the sentence you can just
    recite it in your mind while you type your password (be careful that you don&#39;t
    say it out loud, though ;-) ). It doesn&#39;t have to be as long as this example,
    but should have at least 8 characters.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tOh, and under penalty of
    non-consensual spankings: DON&#39;T use one of the above example passwords, or
    any example password from any website!</p>\r\n"
  After I enter my info, the page just refreshes: "If you have entered your nickname
    and password correctly but after clicking submit it just refreshes the page as
    if nothing happened, you probably have a problem with cookies.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br
    />\r\nOpen up your browser settings and:<br />\r\n-Enable or allow cookies<br
    />\r\n-Turn off any browser extensions or plugins which might be affecting cookies"
  I keep getting an error: "If you are sure that your name and password are correct
    but you keep getting an error message saying that your name or password is wrong...
    Make sure you have javascript enabled.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGo into your browser
    settings and:<br />\r\n-Enable javascript<br />\r\n-Disable any plugins or extensions
    that might be interfering with javascript<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter you fail to
    login a few times there will be a CAPCHA box to fill in below your password but
    without javascript it might not work properly. That means you will not see it
    at all even though the system still expects you to fill it out."
Friends and Relationships:
  How do I add/delete a friend?: "<p>\r\n\tTo add a friend, go to that person&rsquo;s
    profile and on the top right hand side of the profile, under the &quot;Message
    Kinkster&quot; button, you will see an &quot;Add to My Friends&quot; button. Click
    the button and a pop-up box will appear. Just read and follow the instructions
    and you should be good.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIf you have the proper email notification
    setting turned on you will get an email when your friend accepts your friend request.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo
    delete a friend, go to that person&rsquo;s profile and on the top right hand side
    of the profile, under the &quot;Message Kinkster&quot; button, you will see an
    &quot;We are Friends (x)&quot; button. Click the &quot;x&quot;, and your &quot;friend&quot;
    relationship will be terminated. Any relationship statuses you may have had with
    the person will be deleted as well (since you can only be in a relationship with
    a friend).</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBlocking a person will also delete a &quot;friend&quot;
    relationship</p>\r\n"
  How do I add/change/delete a relationship with someone else?: "<p>Adding, changing
    and deleting a relationship with someone else on FetLife is easy (you&#39;re on
    your own for the real-life stuff!!!!) &nbsp;To edit or delete your relationships
    with someone else, click on your nickname in the upper right hand side of your
    browser window. &nbsp;That pops up a drop down box. &nbsp;Click on the &quot;Edit
    Profile&quot; link. &nbsp;From there, you&#39;ll see a tab in the middle marked
    &quot;Relationships in&quot;. &nbsp;The tab has two different types of relationships:
    &quot;Relationships&quot; and &quot;D/s Relationships&quot;. &nbsp;You can add,
    edit, or delete those relationships on this screen. This only changes the relationships
    in *your* profile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please note, in order to have a relationship
    with someone, you have to be &quot;friends&quot; on FetLife first before you can
    have a relationship &quot;benefit&quot;. &nbsp;Also, if you delete someone as
    a friend, any existing relationships with that person are deleted on both sides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Belive
    it or not, there are some &quot;friends&quot; out there who say on their profile
    that they are in a relationship with you without your permission! &nbsp;Yeah,
    I know, that happens in real life too sometimes. &nbsp;There was this one... umm,
    that story is for another day. &nbsp;But on FetLife there is something you can
    do about it! &nbsp;Go to that person&#39;s profile, and hover your mouse (the
    pointer, not the mouse itself...) over the relationship with you. &nbsp;You&#39;ll
    notice a &quot;x delete&quot; link appear to the right, and from there, you can
    delete the relationship!</p>\r\n"
  I can't update my relationship!: "So you can&#39;t update your relationship? &nbsp;That
    sucks, and not in a good way!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nUnfortunately, it seems that
    the AOL branded version of Internet Explorer doesn&#39;t always want to play nicely
    with FetLife. &nbsp;Try to see if it works for you in a different browser like
    for example Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf this doesn&#39;t
    help, please shoot us an email at support@fetlife.com!"
  Why can't I search by age/sex/etc?: "Since FetLife is a social network and not a
    dating site, we&#39;ve opted to not include search filters like that. I mean we
    probably have more hot female members who are willing to take their clothes off
    than pretty much any other website out there... And it&#39;s all because we don&#39;t
    make it as easy for horny guys to find them without some commonality. Obviously
    that&#39;s just one example of why we do what we do, but I hope you see where
    we&#39;re coming from. :-)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs a social network, we encourage
    people to get active in discussions, love pictures, and go out to events in your
    local area. There is a real kickass community here so have fun! Meeting people
    of a certain age/sex/cock or tit size/etc. will happen naturally when you are
    getting yourself out there.&nbsp;"
FetLife Mail:
  I can’t send any more messages, what is this Spam/Jerkface thing?: "<p>You’ve likely
    just joined the site and have been sending a lot of friend requests to people
    you know, sent a lot of messages, and/or commented on a lot of photos (to people
    who are not on your friends’ list yet). When this happens, the FetLife system
    puts you on a small timeout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If this is the case, you have to wait
    a few hours and then try again and everything will be back to normal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We
    know it can be annoying at times but we both hate spam and wankers and this is
    one way we keep FetLife from turning into a big ole spam and wank fest.</p>"
  I’ve seen some text formatting, how can I do this?: <p>Just check out our <a href="https://fetlife.com/formatting_guidelines"
    target="_blank">text formatting guidelines</a>. From there you can even take our
    text formatting tricks for a spin.</p>
  How do I delete or archive a Message?: "<p>\r\n\tJust way too much correspondence
    to sift through, huh? What a great problem to have! And we have some tools to
    help you with it.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tTo delete a message, just open the message you
    want to delete by clicking on the subject line of the message. Now scroll down
    to the bottom of the message and below the text window you will see some buttons.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;Archive
    Conversation&quot; will put in in your Archive so you can save it for later.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\t&quot;Delete&quot;
    will delete the message and once you do that, it will not ever come back. Just
    confirm you want it deleted and it will become history.</p>\r\n"
  How can I find messages I archived or sent?: "From your inbox page (<a href=\"https://fetlife.com/conversations\">https://fetlife.com/conversations</a>)
    there will be an &quot;All Mail&quot; link at the top, just below the &quot;Inbox
    - Conversations&quot; header.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen you click on &quot;All Mail&quot;
    it shows you everything you have sent (even without a response), received and
    archived."
Fetishes:
  How can I add a fetish not listed?: "<p>To begin, we recommend you first search
    for it in the fetish section to make sure it really does not exist yet in our
    database (For example, &quot;John Baku hiring me to create new Fetishes&quot;
    is already there). To search for it click on &quot;Fetishes&quot; in FetLife&#39;s
    header (you might need to click &quot;more&quot; first). From the <a href=\"https://fetlife.com/fetishes\">main
    fetish page</a> type the name of the fetish in the search box that is located
    in the middle of the page. If the fetish is already listed on the site, it will
    show up on the results page. If it isn&rsquo;t, then it will ask if you would
    like to add it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just make sure your fetish is less then 45 characters
    long. If it&rsquo;s more than that, the &quot;Add Fetish&quot; button won&rsquo;t
    show up.</p>\r\n"
  I want to start over!  How can I get rid of all my fetishes?: "So you went overboard
    on all those cute fetishes, your profile page is now three screens long, and you
    figure the only way to handle it is the nuclear option? &nbsp;Email the Caretakers
    at support@fetlife.com, and we can wipe out all your fetishes for you.<br />\r\n<br
    />\r\nDisclaimer: No radiation is caused by the use of the Destroy Fetishes button..."
  How can I remove a fetish from my profile?: "<div>\r\n\tJust click on the fetish
    itself, and you will see two options next to the fetish. &ldquo;Edit&rdquo; will
    let you change how you are into the fetish and &ldquo;remove&rdquo; will, well,
    remove it from your profile.&nbsp;</div>\r\n"
Supporting FetLife:
  Does FetLife automatically re-bill me when my support is up?: "<p>Nope, FetLife
    will never automatically re-bill or extend&nbsp;your support for you. Instead,
    we hope that if you like what we are doing around here you will re-support FetLife
    on your own.</p>\r\n"
  I mailed in a donation, how long till you get it?: "<div>Depends on where you are
    mailing it from, it could take anywhere from 3 days to 2 weeks, sometimes a bit
    more, before we receive it. Once we receive the payment we enter it into the system
    and you are automatically notified via email that we have done so.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>P.S.
    Thanks for your support. It means a lot to us!</div>\r\n"
  I just supported Fetlife, but I can’t see videos yet.: "<p>First off, THANK YOU
    SO MUCH! Sorry about that though :( Very rarely the transaction does not go through
    properly but it happens. We can help though! &nbsp;If you look at your profile
    and don&#39;t see the sexy &quot;I Support FetLife&quot; badge on the right side
    of your profile near where the &quot;Message Kinkster&quot; button&nbsp;is after
    waiting 5 minutes, just email <a href=\"mailto:support@fetlife.com?subject=Support%20Did%20Not%20Go%20Through&amp;body=My%20support%20for%20some%20reason%20did%20not%20go%20through.%20%20Here%20is%20my%20information%3A%0A%0A(Please%20fill%20out%20this%20form)%0ANickname%3A%20%0AAmount%20Paid%3A%0AMethod%20used%3A%20(i.e.%20ACH%2C%20Interac%2C%20Bitcoins%2C%20etc.)%0AMore%20info%3A\">support@fetlife.com</a>
    and we will make it right in a jiffy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you do not see the badge
    on your profile, try emptying your cache, deleting any temporary files and/or
    folders and resetting the browser. Once refreshed, try again, and see if it is
    still happening. If it is, email <a href=\"mailto:support@fetlife.com?subject=Support%20Did%20Not%20Go%20Through&amp;body=My%20support%20for%20some%20reason%20did%20not%20go%20through.%20%20Here%20is%20my%20information%3A%0A%0A(Please%20fill%20out%20this%20form)%0ANickname%3A%20%0AAmount%20Paid%3A%0AMethod%20used%3A%20(i.e.%20ACH%2C%20Interac%2C%20Bitcoins%2C%20etc.)%0AMore%20info%3A\">support@fetlife.com</a>

  I want to support FetLife, but not show my badge: "So you love us and want to support
    us, but you don&#39;t want it to show on your profile that you do support us?
    &nbsp;No problem! &nbsp;You can hide your oh so spiffy support badge at any time
    and still enjoy all the premium benefits of supporting your favorite Kinky Social
    Networking site!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter you support us and your badge appears
    on your profile, just go to your nickname and click on it to access the drop down
    menu. &nbsp;From there, click on &quot;Update Settings&quot; and click on the
    last tab &quot;Payments&quot; &nbsp;You will see &quot;settings&quot; and a radio
    button to turn off the display of your Support FetLife badge, to ensure your privacy!"
  How do I know how long my support runs for?: "<div>Believe it or not, you can check
    this yourself. :-)</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>Just click on your
    nickname to bring up the dropdown menu and select &quot;Update Settings&quot;.
    &nbsp;From there you will see several tabs, click on the last one, &quot;Payments&quot;.
    This will tell you how long you have left as a supporter and your history of billing
    with us!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://fetlife.com/settings/payments\">Here&#39;s
    a shortcut</a></div>\r\n"
  Can I use Paypal to Support FetLife?: Unfortunately, PayPal does not allow sites
    with adult content to use them. We learnt the hard way. We got banned 4 times.
    You can still support us via Postal Mail by checking out the &quot;snail mail&quot;
    tab on <a href="https://fetlife.com/support"> Our Support Page</a>
  How to gift support: "<div>You&#39;re the best! :-) &nbsp;Here is how you&nbsp;gift
    support to someone:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Visit the profile of the person you want
    to gift to, and if they accept gifts, you will see a &quot;Gift FetLife Support&quot;
    link under the &quot;Message Kinkster&quot; button.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Click
    the link and fill out the support form<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBoom. &nbsp;That&#39;s
    all it takes to treat a friend to the best gift this side of the milky way!</div>\r\n\r\n<div><br
    />\r\n&nbsp;</div>\r\n"
  Can I use a credit card to Support FetLife?: Unfortunately, the credit card companies
    closed down our accounts! &nbsp;We&#39;re working with them to open the accounts
    back up, but we don&#39;t know when that will happen. &nbsp;So currently you can&#39;t
    support us via credit cards. &nbsp; You can still support us via other methods
    by checking out &nbsp;<a href="https://fetlife.com/support">Our Support Page</a>.

Events:
  Official Organizer Wants Event Transferred: If you are organizing an event, and
    someone else creates a FetLife event listing to promote it, give the caretakers
    a yell at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:support@fetlife.com?subject=Hey%2C%20this%20is%20*my*%20event!">support@fetlife.com</a>.
    &nbsp;We&#39;ll work with you to get it transferred over to you once you can show
    us that you are the event organizer.
  Where is the event located?: If the event organizer wishes to list where the event
    is located, there is a simple &quot;map&quot; link on the page that will bring
    Google Maps with the event&#39;s location. &nbsp;
  How can I delete my event?: Event planning can have all sorts of hiccups - venues
    cancel, presenters get sick, vice squad raided last week, etc. &nbsp; So sometimes
    you just need to delete an event that you&#39;ve created. &nbsp;How do you do
    that? &nbsp;Simple - go to the Edit Event page. &nbsp;Click on the &quot;Delete
    Event&quot; link, and it&#39;s gone! &nbsp;An email will go out to everyone who
    has RSVPd to the event that it has been deleted.
Suggestion Box:
  Why do I only have three votes?: "The concept about Suggestion Box is not only to
    get ideas about what to do, but get a better grasp at what the members at large
    think is the most important improvements to FetLife! &nbsp;Thus, everybody gets
    3 votes - so choose what you think are the most important!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n"
  How do I vote/unvote for a suggestion?: "&nbsp;You vote for suggestions by clicking
    on the black box that says &quot;Vote&quot;. &nbsp;The number of votes you have
    left out of your three appears on the right hand side of the screen, and the list
    of what you have voted for is below that. &nbsp;You can &quot;unvote&quot; by
    clicking on the red &quot;Voted&quot; button under the total number of votes.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nOnce a product is &quot;In Progress&quot;, you can&#39;t unvote
    for it until it hits &quot;Completed&quot; - but then you automatically get your
    vote back!"
  I want to talk about a suggestion: Talk away! &nbsp;If you click on the suggestion
    itself, it goes to a detail screen - with comment features. &nbsp;So get in there
    and campaign for it!
  How do I find the Suggestion Box?: "We understand. &nbsp;John has problems finding
    the box allll the time...<br />\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p>Look on your main feed page, right
    hand side, just under your Groups. &nbsp;There is a link to it there.</p>\r\n"
Kinky & Popular:
  K&P crashed my browser!  What's up with that?: "Odds are, you&#39;ve got an older
    computer - usually using an older browser - and it just can&#39;t take all the
    luscious, delectable, kinky.... &nbsp;oh wait, you crashed, that wasn&#39;t nice.
    &nbsp;Seriously, loading up to 5,000 different items on your computer can overload
    some older systems. &nbsp;And since we&#39;re not willing to cut back on the amount
    of Kinky &amp; Popular Fet we&#39;re sending out to others, there are currently
    two choices:<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tFigure out how much your computer
    can handle - and don&#39;t go further down the screen than that.</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t\tTry
    updating your browser to the newest version or using a different browser. We recommend
    <a href=\"http://www.google.com/chrome\" target=\"_blank\">Chrome</a> or <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/safari\"
    target=\"_blank\">Safari</a>.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n"
  How does my picture, video or writing make it on to K&P?: "Pictures, videos, and
    writings make it on to K&amp;P based on an algorithm using the activity they&#39;ve
    received over a 24 hour period. &nbsp;Lots of activity in a very short time frame
    means it&#39;s &quot;hot&quot; - viral, almost! &nbsp;(Nooooo jokes about STDs
    and K&amp;Ps, now!) &nbsp;Thresholds differ based on type (picture, video, and
    writing) and based on what else is making the list at the same time.<br />\r\n<br
    />\r\n"
General:
  Change Languages: "With the help of the beautifully diverse community that makes
