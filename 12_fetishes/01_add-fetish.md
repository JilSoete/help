# How can I add a fetish not listed?

To begin, we recommend you first search for it in the fetish section to make sure it really does not exist yet in our database (For example, "John Baku hiring me to create new Fetishes" is already there).

To search for fetishes:

1. Click on "Fetishes" in FetLife's header (you might need to click "more" first).
2. From the [main fetish page](https://fetlife.com/fetishes) type the name of the fetish in the search box that is located in the middle of the page.
3. If the fetish is already listed on the site, it will show up on the results page. If it isn't, then it will ask if you would like to add it.

Just make sure your fetish is less then 45 characters long. If it's more than that, the "Add Fetish" button won't show up.
