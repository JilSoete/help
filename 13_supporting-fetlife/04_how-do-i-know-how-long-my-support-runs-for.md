# How do I know how long my support runs for?

Believe it or not, you can check this yourself. :-)

1. Click your nickname at the top-right corner of FetLife and click "Update Settings" from the dropdown menu.
2. Click on the "Payments" tab.

This will tell you how long you have left as a supporter and your history of billing with us!
