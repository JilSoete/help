# I want to support FetLife, but not show my badge

So you love us and want to support us, but you don't want it to show on your profile that you do support us? No problem! You can hide your oh-so-spiffy support badge at any time and still enjoy all the premium benefits of supporting your favourite Kinky Social Networking site!

After you support us and your badge appears on your profile:

1. Click your nickname at the top-right corner of FetLife and click "Update Settings" from the dropdown menu.
2. Click on the last tab "Payments".
3. Here you can toggle the Support FetLife Badge off.
