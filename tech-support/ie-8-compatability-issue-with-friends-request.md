# IE 8 Compatability Issue with Friends Request

The Fetlife development and caretaker teams both worked hard to come up with fixes to the Friends Request bug. Some of the hair lost there may never come back...

The first fixes happened pretty quickly - Chrome, Internet Explorer (IE) 9, etc., were fixed in short order (hours) by the development team. That left reports on IE 7 and 8. We don't support IE 7 - two versions of IE are difficult enough! But IE 8 was trickier, because we couldn't replicate it. Some of our wonderful creative members found short-term work-a-rounds for the bug, and many of you helped out in sending in screen shots, support details and more. We love kinky bug killers, and you guys helped slaughter this one! (Electric bug zappers were not required in the crushing of this bug, and no actual insects were harmed...)

Finally, one of our intrepid caretakers, using all this input, found the issue - it was with members using IE8 in compatibility mode. We've tested it with some of you, and this has solved the problem in all of those cases.

Here is what to do:

1. Head over to your friend request page and you will see your the number of requests, but not the actual pending requests.
2. Look on your Internet Explorer browser and click on "Tools" and from the drop down menu over on the right, look at "Compatibility View" and see if there is a check mark besides it.
3. If you see one, click on "Compatibility View" to remove the check mark and the page should refresh. It should show your pending friend requests now.
4. If it didn't fix the problem, look down in the bottom left hand corner of the page and there should be a yellow box. Click on it and copy and paste the text into an email for us and we can look further into it for you.
