# Whatâ€™s a FetLife Ban?

When warnings, Restraining Orders, and Time-Outs don't work, we sadly have to consider banning a member from the site. Even here, we try for a measured approach. We'll ban someone from FetLife for a period of time. If they violate the ban, we may opt to extend it, and at times make it permanent.
