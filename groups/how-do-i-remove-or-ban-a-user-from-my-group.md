# How do I remove or ban a user from my group?

If you are a group leader, there are two ways you can ban a user from your group.

The first option is to click on the "Members" tab in the group and search for the user you want to remove or ban from the group.

Once you find them click on the "moderate &or;" button next to them. From that drop down menu you will be able to remove or ban them from your group.

Alternatively, a group leader can ban a member right from a comment that they made. To the right of each member's name, there is a link that says "options". Click on that, and the options "delete", "ban", and "close" pop up. Click on "ban", and the user is banned from your group.

If you remove a user from the group, all of their posts will remain in the group. If you need to moderate a recently banned member's posts, you will have to do that separately from banning them.
