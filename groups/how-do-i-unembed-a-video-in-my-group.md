# How do I unembed a video in my group?

Youtube video embedding is fun! But, with the proliferation of Youtube videos being posted in groups, some group owners have asked us "What do we do if there are minors in the videos?". The answer is quite simple - all you have to do in unembed the video, since links to pictures or videos with non-sexualized images of minors is ok. This leaves the link and the discussion in place, but removes the video from FetLife itself.

All you have to do is add the word "UNEMBED" on the same line before the link. For example:

[http://www.youtube.com/watch](http://www.youtube.com/watch.... "")........ - puts in an embedded video

UNEMBED[http://www.youtube.com/watch](http://www.youtube.com/watch.... "").... - takes out the embedding
