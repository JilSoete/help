# How can I add or remove group leaders?

If you are a group owner, click on the "Members" tab in the group and search for the user you want to add or remove as a group leader from the group.

Once you find them click on the "moderate &or;" button next to them. From that drop down menu you will be able to add or remove the user as a group leader.

*Note: only one user can be a group owner, but you can have many group leaders.*
