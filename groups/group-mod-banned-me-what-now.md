# The "mod" banned me from the group - what can I do about it?

One of the beauties of FetLife's structure (I know, bad word for pseudo-anarchists like us!) is that there is always an alternative to a group owner or leader banning you from a group.

Create your own group.

While we give group owners and leaders considerable power in deciding group membership, it's countered by the ability to create your own group about the same subject if you wish. Group owners and leaders who go megalomaniacal (whew - fingers tired after that one!) often find their group members voting with their feet - off to another group. Democracy in action, baby!
