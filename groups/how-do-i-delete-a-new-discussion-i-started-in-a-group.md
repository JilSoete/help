# How do I delete a new discussion I started in a group?

To have a post or comment in a group deleted you will have to contact one of the group leaders to remove it for you. The removal of a post or comment will be up to the discretion of the group leaders, so before posting make sure you do what my mother still tells me to this day - "Think twice before you open your mouth" (or type on the keyboard, in this case)!
