# How do I join/leave a group?

To join a group, you first have to find a group you are interested in joining. There are three ways to find groups that catch your attention:

* [Browse our Most Popular Groups](https://fetlife.com/groups/most_popular "");
* [Search for groups by keyword](https://fetlife.com/search/groups "");
* Check out what groups your friends are members of.

Once you find a group you are interested in joining click the "Join Group" link just below the group's name. Then read over the group's description, rules and restrictions and if you still feel the group is for you then click the "Join this Group" button.

What if the group is not for you anymore? No problem, within the group itself and just under the group name, you&rsquo;ll see a link to "leave group". Click on the link, confirm you want to leave the group and presto, you are no longer a member of the group.
