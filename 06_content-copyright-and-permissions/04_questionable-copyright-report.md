# Questionable Copyright report

So you're perving through some pics, and suddenly you stop and go "Waaaaait a sec... This is my buddy's picture!" What are you gonna do about it?

Simple - Click on "Report Picture", then on "I don't think this kinkster has permission to post this picture". Let us know whose picture it really is, and we'll contact the copyright owner from there. If they tell us the picture is theirs and they didn't give permission for it to be posted, we'll take it down.

This process also works for writings and videos.
