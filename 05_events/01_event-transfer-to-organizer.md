# Official Organizer Wants Event Transferred

If you are organizing an event, and someone else creates a FetLife event listing to promote it, give the caretakers a yell at [support@fetlife.com](mailto:support@fetlife.com?subject=Hey%2C%20this%20is%20*my*%20event! ""). We'll work with you to get it transferred over to you once you can show us that you are the event organizer.
